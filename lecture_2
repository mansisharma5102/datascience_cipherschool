Life Cycle of a Data Science Project

Understanding the Problem

Clearly define the project’s objectives.
Determine the criteria for measuring success.
Identify the type of problem (e.g., classification, regression).
Gathering Relevant Data

Collect data from various sources.
Ensure the data is pertinent to the problem.
Consider the data’s volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.
Data Preparation & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data better.
Prepare the data to be error-free and ready for modeling.
Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction

Select the specific features required for the analysis.
Create new features to enhance model performance.
Reduce dimensionality if there are too many features.
Select the most important features for modeling.
Model Building & Deployment

Select appropriate algorithms and train the models.
Validate the model’s performance using cross-validation.
Deploy the model for real-time application or batch processing.
